<!-- 1 ng new demo -->
<!-- 2 ng g c componentName -->

<!-- created a navbar component then we took the selector from its ts file and placed it here -->
<app-navbar></app-navbar>

<!-- This tells angular to check the component that should be rendered by current route and place it here -->
<router-outlet></router-outlet>

<!-- remember that app.component.html is  the bootstrap component -> index.html reads this -->

<!-- This is why we have router-outlet here..... -->
